# Hotel-Booking-cancellation-analysis-excel-power-bi
This project uses exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify patterns in booking behavior and pinpoint drivers of cancellations across hotel types, seasons, and customer segments. It demonstrates core data-analyst skills: data cleaning, feature understanding, visualization, and clear business recommendations.

🎯 Objectives

Clean and preprocess the dataset for analysis.

Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify patterns and trends.

Visualize booking and cancellation behaviors.

Highlight the most influential factors behind cancellations.

Suggest data-driven strategies to reduce cancellations.

📂 Dataset

The dataset used contains booking information such as:

Hotel type (City Hotel, Resort Hotel)

Lead time

Number of special requests

Customer type

Deposit type

Booking channel & market segment

Cancellation status

Source: Kaggle – Hotel Booking Demand Dataset

🛠️ Tools & Libraries

Python: Data processing & analysis

Pandas, NumPy: Data wrangling

Matplotlib, Seaborn: Data visualization

Scikit-learn (optional): Predictive modeling

Jupyter Notebook: Interactive analysis

📊 Key Insights

Longer lead times significantly increase cancellation probability.

Customers with non-refundable deposits are less likely to cancel.

Repeated guests tend to cancel less compared to first-time guests.

Seasonal and market segment differences strongly influence cancellations.

🚀 Project Workflow

Data Cleaning – Handle missing values, duplicates, and outliers.

EDA – Statistical summaries and trend analysis.

Visualization – Cancellation trends by season, deposit type, lead time, etc.

Insights – Identify top cancellation drivers.

Recommendations – Strategies for hotels to reduce cancellations.

📌 Outcomes

Clear understanding of the top 3 drivers of cancellations.

Visual reports to support decision-making in hotel operations.

Foundation for building a predictive cancellation model in the future.

🔮 Next Steps

Develop a machine learning model to predict high-risk cancellations.

Create an interactive dashboard (Tableau/Power BI) for hotel managers.
